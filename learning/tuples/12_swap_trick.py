#Write a Python program to swap the values of two variables using tuple unpacking, without using a temporary third variable.
#Purpose: This exercise demonstrates one of Python’s most well-known idioms. The swap trick works because Python evaluates the entire right-hand side as a tuple before performing any assignment, making it both concise and safe. It is a practical showcase of how unpacking can replace verbose boilerplate code.
a = 100
b=200
a, b = b,a
print(f"After Swap: a= {a}, b = {b}")
