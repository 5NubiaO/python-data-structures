#Write a Python program to sort a tuple of tuples based on the second item in each nested tuple.
#Purpose: This exercise teaches you how to use the key parameter of Python’s sorted() function with a lambda to sort structured data by a specific field – a technique used constantly when ordering records, rankings, and tabular data.
students = (("Alice", 88), ("Bob", 73), ("Charlie", 95), ("Diana", 61))
sorteds = tuple(sorted(students, key=lambda x: x[1]))

print(f"Sorted: {sorteds}")
